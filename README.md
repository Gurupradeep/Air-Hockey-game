# Air-Hockey-game

#ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is the demonstration of a simple multiplayer air hockey game. It involves two

players, each with a computer with the game running in it. Both the players need to be

connected to the same network (preferably wired connection to minimize latency issues). After

establishing a communicating port between the players the game then begins. The rules of the

game are quite straight forward. Each player has a mallet (a circular disk) and there are two

pucks which are common to both of them. There is a rectangular arena where the game is

played. The players are placed on either side of the arena which is separated by a center line.

Player can control the movement of mallet in his side using his mouse. One player cannot take

his mallet to the other side.

The objective of each player is to keep the pucks in the opponent side as long as possible in a

given span of time. The players are allowed to maneuver the puck using their respective

mallets. While doing so, players should refrain from crossing the half line. The scores of both

players are initialized to zero. As and when pucks moves to the opponent side the player score

will keep incrementing. When the time runs out, the player with the higher score is proclaimed

the winner, or if the scores are level, the match ends as a draw.
